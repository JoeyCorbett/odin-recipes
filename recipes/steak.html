        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Filet mignon is the smaller tip of tenderloin and one of the most
             expensive cuts of steak, due to its prized texture and that it's
            only about 2% of the total animal.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>(6-oz.) filet mignon</li>
            <li>Kosher Salt</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. roughly chopped rosemary</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400Â°. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat oil. Season steak with salt and pepper on both sides</li>
            <li>When oil is just about to smoke, add steak. Cook until very seared, about 5 minutes, then flip and add butter and rosemary.</li>
            <li>Baste with butter and cook another 3 to 5</li>
            <li>Transfer skillet to oven and cook until cooked to your liking, about 5 minutes for medium</li>
            <li>If you are within 10 degrees, you may need even less time. If your steak isn't done after 5 minutes, check every couple of minutes so you don't risk over cooking.</li>
            <li></li>Remove from pan and let rest 5 minutes before slicing.</li>
        </ol>
